<p>This fact sheet provides basic information about acai (pronounced AH-sigh-EE)—common names, usefulness and safety, and resources for more information.</p>


<h3 id="bkgrnd">Background</h3>
The acai palm tree, native to tropical Central and South America, produces a deep purple fruit. The word “acai,” which comes from a language of the native people of the region, means “fruit that cries.” The acai fruit has long been an important food source for indigenous peoples of the Amazon region.

Acai products have become popular in the United States, where they have been marketed for weight-loss and anti-aging purposes.

The Federal Trade Commission has taken action against companies that marketed acai weight loss products in allegedly deceptive ways.

Acai fruit pulp has been used experimentally as an oral contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Acai products are available as juices, powders, tablets, and capsules.

<h3 id="know">How Much Do We Know?</h3>
Very little research has been done in people on the health effects of acai products.

<h3 id="learn">What Have We Learned?</h3>
There’s no definitive scientific evidence based on studies in people to support the use of acai for any health-related purpose. No independent studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals that substantiate claims that acai alone promotes rapid weight loss. Researchers who investigated the safety profile of an acai-fortified juice in rats observed that there were no body weight changes in animals given the juice compared with animals that didn’t receive it.&gt;/p&gt;

A preliminary study suggested that eating acai fruit pulp might reduce blood sugar and cholesterol levels in overweight people. Laboratory studies have focused on acai’s potential antioxidant properties, and a juice blend with acai as the main ingredient has been shown to have an antioxidant effect in people. (Antioxidants are substances that may protect cells against certain types of damage.)

<h3 id="safety">What Do We Know About Safety?</h3>
There is little reliable information about the safety of acai as a supplement. It is widely consumed as an edible fruit or as a juice. Consuming acai might affect MRI test results. If you use acai products and are scheduled for an MRI, check with your health care provider.
